# Data structure description

The elastic Lateral-plus-Window (LpW) 2D stack, which has a single window bounding the top row of all sub-stacks. It encompasses elastic relaxation, and is able to change window dimensions during run-time. It uses a Lateral stack to track elastic changes in width, which is used to update the window correctly.
