# Data structure description

The coupled 2D stack, which has a single window bounding the top row of all sub-stacks. Optimized version of 2Dc-stack to keep up with the scalability of the elastic implementation.

## Origin

Introduced in the [first 2D paper](https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.DISC.2019.31), but implemented as an optimization for the [elastic 2D paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13644).
